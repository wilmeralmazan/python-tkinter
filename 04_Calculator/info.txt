This task involves creating a simple calculator application with a user-friendly interface, estimated to take about 20-30 minutes and classified as easy in difficulty. The objectives are to:

Gain practical experience with Tkinter widgets: Entry for user input, Radiobutton for operation selection, and Button for initiating calculations.
Learn to organize these widgets using Tkinter's grid manager.
Implement input validation to ensure users enter valid data (integers or floats), and handle any errors that occur.
The calculator should have two input fields for arguments, a set of radio buttons for selecting the mathematical operation, and an "Evaluate" button to perform the calculation. The expected behavior is:

If both fields have valid inputs, pressing "Evaluate" displays the result in an information window.
If either field contains invalid input (like a string or is left empty), an error window should appear, pinpointing the issue and shifting focus to the problematic field.
Additionally, the calculator needs to handle edge cases such as division by zero. The task focuses on both frontend GUI design and backend logic implementation.
